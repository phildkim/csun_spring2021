\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
  \item After the conclusion of this simulation, log your results. Start this by attaching a screenshot of your graph. In which direction did the allele frequencies change?
  \item Explain the mechanism by which these changes occurred. What is this mechanism called?
  \item Which of the three genotypes do you think would be most fit in a rural area, far from cities, such as the woods in the far South of England?
  \item Which of the three genotypes do you think would be most fit in the woods near industrial cities?
  \item What do you think happened after England passed clean air laws?
  \item Play around with the simulation and change the ``selection against Black, selection against White.'' What do you notice?
