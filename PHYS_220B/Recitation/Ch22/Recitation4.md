# Chapter 22

1) A region of space contains an electric field $\overrightarrow{E} = E_1\widehat{i} + E_2\widehat{j}$ where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are positive constants. A frame whose corners are located at (x, y, z) = $(\frac{a}{2}, 0, \frac{a}{2})$, $(-\frac{a}{2}, 0,-\frac{a}{2})$, $(\frac{a}{2}, 0,-\frac{a}{2})$, and $(-\frac{a}{2}, 0, \frac{a}{2})$. What is the magnitude of the electric flux through the frame?

2) A uniform electric field with a magnitude of 6 × 106 $\frac{N}{C}$ is applied to a cube of edge length 0.1m as shown in Fig. 22-2. If the direction of the E-field is along the +x-axis, what is the electric flux passing through the shaded face of the cube?

3) A spherical, non-conducting shell of inner radius $r_1 = 10$ cm and outer radius $r_2= 15$ cm carries a total charge Q = 15 µC distributed uniformly throughout its volume. What is the electric field at a distance r = 12 cm from the center of the shell? (SHOW ALL YOUR WORK, DERIVE THE EXPRESSION)


4) A nonconducting spherical shell of inner radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ contains a uniform volume charge density Ε throughout the shell. Use Gauss's law to derive an equation for the magnitude of the electric field at the following radial distances r from the center of the sphere. Your answers should be in terms of $\rho$, $R_1$, $R_2$, r, $\epsilon_0$ , and $\pi$ (SHOW ALL YOUR WORK, DERIVE THE EXPRESSION)
a) r < $R_1$
b) $R_1$ < r $R_2$
c) r > $R_2$


5) A nonuniform electric field is directed along the x-axis at all points in space. This magnitude of the field varies with x, but not with respect to y or z. The axis of a cylindrical surface, 0.80 m long and 0.20 m in diameter, is aligned parallel to the x-axis, as shown in the figure. The electric fields $E_1$ and $E_2$, at the ends of the cylindrical surface, have magnitudes of 9000 $\frac{N}{C}$ and 5000 $\frac{N}{C}$ respectively, and are directed as shown. ($\epsilon_0$ = 8.85 × 10-12 $\frac{C^2}{N}\cdot{m}^2$) The charge enclosed by the cylindrical surface is closest to
