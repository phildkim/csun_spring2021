# Research Paper

## Due Apr 25 by 11:59pm

Your research paper should be uploaded here. It should be 5 to 7 pages long,  not counting the bibliography, double spaced, and should include the annotated bibliography which you have created for a previous assignment.   Here are those details in more detail:

* Double-spaced with one-inch margins (top, bottom, left, and right). Include your name and page number in the header (top â€“ aligned right); include your name, Prof. Name, Class name, date on the left side.

* A cover sheet is not necessary

If you have changed your paper topic significantly since you submitted your bibliography, you can add new citations to the annotated bibliography you previously created.  Use the same format for your title page and numbered pages as you used in your bibliography.
